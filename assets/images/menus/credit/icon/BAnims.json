Anyways, like the majority of the team probably have already said, even though it’s had some ups and downs, it was still a pretty fun project for me to work on, and I’d like to thank my friends that got me to where I am today. Another thing, this mod made me love Gengar as I was working on the sprites for him, because ‘GOO GOO GOO GAAAAAH."
